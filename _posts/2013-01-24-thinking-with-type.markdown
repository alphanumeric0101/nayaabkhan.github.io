I just finished reading <a href='http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/' target='blank'>Thinking with Type</a> by Ellen Lupton and I feel it is an indispensible guide for any typographer and even for any Web designer. So I thought of sharing a review with you all guys.

There are a lot of great concepts in this book, so I decided to create a few designs using typography to show off my favorites.

> Think more, design less.

Some type crimes to be aware of:

* Horizontal and vertical scaling
* Vertically stacking lowercase
* Using too many signals (bold, italic, underlined, caps)
* Don't trap data in heavily guarded cells
